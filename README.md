# Cloud Security Posture Management - Maturity Model

## Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)

CSPM is an area of security that focuses on the security posture of cloud assets. IT security tools that fall under the CSPM category are designed to detect and remediate misconfigurations, ultimately assisting companies in their compliance and regulatory assessments. CSPM tools continuously monitor cloud infrastructure, identify gaps, and provide remediation solutions to fix misconfigurations.
One of the basic and most important components of any cloud security program is ensuring that cloud infrastructure is well protected â€“ that is the component that requires a well-defined CSPM program and toolset. 


## CSPM Maturity Model
The pillars of the CSPM maturity model are defined based on past CSPM tool implementations and may evolve over time as we test and apply this model to more CSPM implementations. But the idea here is to identify what stage you are at now, where you want to be, and outline the steps on how to get there.
This model will help you to simplify your CSPM processes rollout and  provide guiding principles for successful implementation of a continuous CSPM program, allowing you to assess your CSPM readiness and plan your own implementation journey.

## How to implement CSPM maturity model
While a CSPM maturity model is most effective when integrated across all cloud environments, most organizations will need to take a phased approach that targets specific areas of their cloud based on their CSPM maturity, available resources, and priorities. It will be important to consider each phase carefully and align them with current business needs. 

The first step of your journey does not have to be a large change of your CSPM process or toolset. Fortunately, each step forward will make a difference in reducing cloud risk and making your cloud journey more secure.
